# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

Our bot's goal is to produce a standard bot for all locations and to break the stereotype of thousands of bots on one server.

## Our Values

### Be Compassionate

We show compassion to everyone we meet, understanding the humanity underneath their issues and experiences.

### Be Mindful

We do not take advantage of our consumers' attention and utilize mindful working methods to create safe places in both our working environment and our goods.

### Research First

Through qualitative and quantitative research, we question our own and others' assumptions. Are you unsure about an idea? Test it.
